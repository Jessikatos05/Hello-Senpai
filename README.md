# Hello Senpai

## Concept description
While developing this application I hope to make learning Japanese more fun and exciting. Where they could play learning games vs each other and share content of their culture all while learning the language. A possible name I would come up for this application is called Hello Senpai.  “Hello” is one of the first thing we say to greet each other for the very first time. In Japanese “Senpai means” Senior. In most situations when we are in a learning state, we are being taught by wise elders. It is a clever name for the concept of this application.
