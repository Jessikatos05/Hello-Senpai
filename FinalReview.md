##Final Project Review

- What did you do right?
In the end I choose what i was passionate about and i felt that gave me the strenght to keep pushing to get the info i could to keep going. also reaching out to my classmates helped me a lot because it got me close to the answers i was looking for.
    
- What did you do wrong?
I think i choose a too advanced place to start for the type of application i have produced. I spent a lot of time reserching best was to implement the elements of my application as a beginner Coder. I felt that i bit way more than i can chew. Also i dont think i didnt do well with my database relationships at first they didnt have the right connections. also since i felt my project was so complexed i was to indesisve on to start on another project insted.


- Where were you lucky?
i feel like i was lucky that i had some prior knowledge to HTML CSS which i felt was super simple to implement into my project
